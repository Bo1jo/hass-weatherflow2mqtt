# Home Assistant WeatherFlow2MQTT Changelog

## Version 2.0.0

**Release Date**: NOT RELEASED YET

### Changes in this release

* `NEW`: There is now a new sensor called `pressure_trend`. This sensor monitors the Sea Level pressure changes. The Pressure Trend state is determined by the rate of change over the past 3 hours. It can be one of the following: `Steady`, `Falling` and `Rising`.
* `NEW`: The simple storage system, that used two flat files, has now been rewritten, to use a SQLite Database instead. This will make future developments easier, and is also the foundation for the new Pressure Trend sensor. If you are already up and running with this program, your old data will automatically be migrated in to the new SQLite Database. And once you are confident that all is running, you can safely delete `.storage.json` and `.lightning.data`.
